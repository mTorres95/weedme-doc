### Option 1: link 

[Create a component](/Components/3.1.CreateaComponent.pdf)

**Pro:** The search highlights it (only if you're in the "How To" page)

**Con:** It directs you to the pdf, making you loose the menu on the left
(You can, however, just go back)

---

### Option 2: embed

{{< pdf "/Components/3.1.CreateaComponent.pdf" >}}

**Pro:** You get the PDF in the page

**Con:** You have to scroll and in order to use the search, we'd have to
add a title, which could be a bit too repetitive (the title is in 
the "name" of the embed and in the PDF itself)

---

### Option 3: go for a more manual approach

1. Navigate to "Components" tab

**Pro:** Looks more integrated

**Con:** It's quite more manual work and can get long
